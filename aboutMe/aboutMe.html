                <p>
                    My name is Kacey Weaver - I was born and brought up around horses my whole life. My mother had her
                    heart horse; Ellie, who became one of the first horses I ever rode. Ellie was a beautiful,
                    registered American Quarter Horse mare who had a heart of gold. She gave me a lot of my firsts when
                    it came to the horse world in both regular riding and showing. The image to the right was taken in
                    2006 when I was only four years old.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ellie had taken me miles and miles in my progress as a rider - when the time was right we then got a
                    pony. We named the pony Tornado, and she very quickly became my heart "horse" even through the tough
                    times when we were learning each other. We purchased Tornado in 2010 with her being able to ride
                    western, and by 2013 I was taking her to the 4-H fair with Ellie. The more I competed with them, the
                    more I had a desire to keep going and keep experiencing new things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Growing up I did everything I could with the horses, from halter to western pleasure and barrels to
                    english pleasure and jumping. I dabbled with cross country, pole bending, horsemanship, anything I
                    could. Everything I could do in a saddle, I was able to do bareback. Throughout my life<i>(up to
                        2022)</i> I have had many accomplishments, both in the show ring and behind closed doors with
                    both Ellie and Tornado.

                    <u>A few major accomplishments Iâ€™ve made with the horses<i>(up to 2022)</i>
                    follow;</u><br>
                    &bull; Ellie and I usually took home first place/champion in each of our 4-H classes except for a
                    few each
                    year we entered.<br>
                    &bull; 2014 I started trick and liberty training on my own with Tornado - she learned how to bow,
                    lay
                    down, sit, stay, come, do liberty circles, rear, and play dead all on cue.<br>
                    &bull; 2018 Ellie and I won the Miss Tri-State Jr. Rodeo Queen contest, rode in the Tri-State
                    Rodeo, and the Parade.<br>
                    &bull; 2019 Ellie and I won Grand Champion in the Youth Division at the River Valley Trail
                    Challenge.<br>
                    &bull; 2020 Ellie and I won Grand Champion in the Pro Division at the River Valley Trail
                    Challenge.<br>
                    &bull; 2020 I started client training for the first time, and had roughly four to five different
                    clients
                    through the summer.<br>
                    &bull; 2022 client trained again, and I had around five to six different clients throughout the
                    summer and
                    fall.
