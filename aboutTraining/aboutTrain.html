                <p>
                    In 2020 I started publicly client training horses, however I had experience working with and
                    training multiple horses prior<i>(My own, friend's, and lesson horses)</i>. The basics of
                    how I train/work with horses all boils down to connection, bonding. I'm not going to ask a
                    1,000lb animal to do something it's never done, or is scared to do if they don't trust me - it won't
                    get them or me anywhere.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I pride myself on taking my time and never trying to rush a horse - on building a connection with
                    them before just asking them to do something they have never done before. When it comes to possible
                    clients like you, I like discussing a lot of information about your horse(s) and not just the kind
                    of training you
                    are after. Along with the basics, I also like to know how they typically act, are they calm, have
                    lots of energy, pin
                    their ears in the stall, etc. By doing this I can let you know where I could reasonably see your
                    horse in 30, 60,
                    or 90 days of training,
                    and give you a recommendation for a shorter or longer stay for the results you are after. I will
                    always
                    work with you on what you want the end goal to be, but I will also explain that there is always a
                    possibility,
                    even just a small one, that by the time the training is up, the full end goal may not be met. This is
                    because
                    every horse is going to learn and adjust differently and may need more time then what was chosen or
                    something
                    completely different training wise. However, I will always do my best to get the horse(s) the
                    furthest they can
                    go in the period of time chosen, along with giving you every other if not daily updates on your
                    horse(s) so you
                    can stay caught up on what's going on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As for trainers, I don't personally follow/have a specific trainer I like, nor do I use every
                    method
                    another trainer has. I have my own methods that I've adjusted from other trainers, and from what has
                    worked
                    best for me. For example, I like to understand each horse I work with and to me, the first step is
                    knowing
                    that each one will respond to things differently. Due to that, the <u>ONLY</u> method I use across
                    the
                    board with every horse is Pressure and Release. Even that method has a wide range of options on how
                    to
                    apply it which is why I am comfortable using it with every horse. Each horse I work with gets their
                    own
                    personalized training plan, methods, etc. because each one is going to grow and improve differently.
                    For example; I may have an unstarted three year old riding like a green broke horse<small><i>(walk,
                            jog,
                            lope both ways, stop, and back)</i></small> within nine days, but I could also have a
                            traumatized, riding
                    horse spook at the saddle for three weeks before they are ready to have it back on.
                </p>
                <p>

                    I don't have a preferred 'style' of training either. The way I train is purely based on each
                    individual
                    horse and their specific needs. Every horse is going to be different, be it their breed, mindset,
                    build, how they learn, etc. While a method that may have worked for one hundred horses, there will
                    always be some that don't learn with that method. I want to be flexible enough to give every
                    horse the chance to grow, and improve without limiting myself or them just because this one
                    learns/grows
                    differently from the last.
                </p>

                            <b>First Video:</b> Top left the video showcases a client's chestnut two-year-old being lunged over a tarp
                            with a halter on after being handled a few days.<br>
                            <b>Second Video:</b> Second to the left video is a three year old
                            chestnut who was in for 30 days to be started under saddle. After some time we took him to 
                            River Valley and had a go on their trails.<br>
                            <b>Third Video:</b> Second to the right video showcases another client's horse with the saddle on for 
                            his second time. He had gone from completely unhandled to being saddled in about four days.<br>
                            <b>Fourth Video:</b> On the far right showcases the same two-year-old as the first video, but with a saddle on.
                            Both videos were taken on the same day, within 30 minutes of each other.<br>
                            <b>Fifth Video:</b> Shown on the bottom left showcases a client's horse that came in to be restarted. The video shows 
                            me working up to fully mounting him, while taking my time to adjust him to the feel of a leg that may randomly touch 
                            his butt.<br>
                            <b>Sixth Video:</b> Shown on the bottom right is a small portion of an Extreme Trail Challenge show
                            Ellie and I entered during 2020.<br>
