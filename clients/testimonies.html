                    <p><q>I met Kacey for the first time when we were both in high school at a small show, at a barn in
                            Ft. Madison, Iowa. I watched her excel in all classes, and I remember being in awe of how
                            well she rode the courses. Throughout the years I’ve watched her progress and successes in
                            the horse industry. And when I finally got my own horse, I knew if he ever needed a little
                            extra help, I’d send him to the person I trusted most, Kacey. Angus, my Tennessee Walker was
                            gifted to me when he was only 2 1/2. I knew he’d be an excellent trail horse, but he just
                            needed to learn every twig snap, or water crossing wasn’t the end of the world. I had to
                            undergo a major spinal injury and surgery the summer after I got him, so I wanted to make
                            sure he was safe for me to blaze the trails the following year. Kacey took him on for about
                            a month and worked with him almost daily to make sure he was the perfect steed on the
                            trails. And she more than exceeded my expectations, he became the best, most trustworthy
                            trail partner a girl could ask for. Even now, at his current owners, he’s still their “go
                            to” trail horse. Not only is Kacey dependable, she’s caring, responsible, and extremely
                            trustworthy. She will forever get my business whenever my horses need some fine tuning, or
                            even breaking.

                    <p><q>I found Kacey on Facebook a couple of years ago - I believe she was just out of high school.
                            She was in the same group about horses I was, I reached out to her and asked her if she
                            would be willing to work with my girl; Amora. I had been watching some of the things she had
                            been doing with her pony Tornado - I was very impressed. I am disabled and it is hard for me
                            to get on and off my girl. Kacey agreed to help me - I hadn’t had Amora very long when I
                            asked Kacey for her help. Amora was leery of people she didn’t know, but not with Kacey. She
                            was comfortable with her. This put me at ease leaving my girl with her. Kacey kept me in the
                            loop on how things were going at all times. Kacey had Amora laying down for you to mount in
                            no time at all. Kacey is very talented, she has a good hand when working with your horse. I
                            highly recommend her to everyone. She may be young but she is good. She has the true heart
                            for the horse and her work shows it. A very satisfied customer. </q>
