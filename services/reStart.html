                    and you want to start riding them again? Do you have a horse that's been broke to ride, sat for

                    and now doesn't want to take the saddle? If any of these seem like your situation or somewhat close,

                    (Video shows me working with a horse who was in to be restarted. He was skittish and spooky 
                    about every little thing, so I am working on just lightly touching his butt.)

                <p>
                    At Rocky's Horsemanship we work with you on restarting your horse, to help remind them of their
                    foundation, or give them a stronger one to continue on with. The first step we take in restarting
                    your horse is helping them feel safe, and comfortable enough to trust us. We consider this the most
                    important step because if they don't trust us, we aren't going to get very far with getting them on
                    the right path. </p>
                <p>
                    We let the horse help us to set the pace of the training so we don't overload them with too
                    much information. This way your horse will hopefully be able to retain what they've learned better,
                    and help to keep a solid foundation for new things in the future. However, because of this we
                    require your horse to be with us for a minimum of 60 days, though there is no maximum length of
                    stay. This
                    can better assure a constant training plan with your horse that will also hopefully provide clear
                    improvement,
                    even if it may take longer than 60 days.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Restarting is not only limited to horses that may have had issues in the past with training, have
                    sat for several years, and or are spooky/unsure about tack or people. Restarting is open and
                    encouraged
                    to horses that may be considered aggressive, have been drugged, and or abused in the past. We want
                    to give each horse a chance at improvement to continue bettering themselves, create a solid
                    foundation, make them safer, and sometimes even help them gain a true second chance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When inquiring about restarting your horse(s) please include any and all information you have about
                    why you believe they need to be restarted. Things like; what your goal(s) is at the end of their
                    stay, any
                    information from their past that you know or think could relate to the issue(s), and how long you
                    are hoping to leave your horse with us. This information will be helpful so we can create the
                    correct training
                    plan to give your horse a solid chance at improvement.
